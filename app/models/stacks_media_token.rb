require 'resolv'

# this class is used for representing a time-limited grant of authorization to
# view a streaming resource.  the token object has fields representing the resource
# (id, file_name) and the request origin (user_ip). additionally,
# it has a timestamp indicating when it was created.
#
# the object can be serialized as a signed/encrypted string representation of
# itself.  the class can also create an instance of itself from such a representation.
#
# the class can also take an arbitrary string and a list of expected values for the
# token's fields.  if the string can be decrypted successfully (proving stacks
# minted it), the recovered hash can be checked against the provided list of values
# and the current time.  if the expected values match the decrypted values and the
# token is younger than the max age, it's good, otherwise, it's not.
#
# thus, stacks can mint a token string and give it to a user, who can give it
# to a service that stacks trusts, to allow that service to fulfil a request
# to stream a resource.
#
# the order of operations might be something like the following example:
# * a user makes a request to a stacks URL for a streaming resource.
# * stacks creates a StacksMediaToken and serializes it to its encrypted string form.
# * the encrypted string form of the token is included as part of a redirect to wowza.
# * wowza receives the request for the resource stream, with the encrypted string.
# * wowza calls back to stacks, and passes along: encrypted token string, IP from which
#   it received the request, id, and file name.
# * stacks uses StacksMediaToken#verify_encrypted_token? to determine whether
#   the encrypted string represents a still-valid token for the given resource.
# * if it does, it returns 200 OK to wowza, if it doesn't then it returns 403 Forbidden.
# * wowza serves the stream or not based on the response it gets from stacks.
# * this checking in wowza can be implemented via a wowza request processing plugin.
#
# notes:
# * there's no check for whether a token's been used (there's no record of the token having been
#   created in memory or DB, and so nothing to mark).  but that might be a good additional check.
# * encrypted token verfication assumes that an attacker cannot create a valid encrypted token string
#   without having compromised the stacks server, since the secret_key_base is needed to create a valid
#   encrypted token string.  also, the usual caveats about trusting the math, and Rails' implementation
#   of it, and our use of their implementation.

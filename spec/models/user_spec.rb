# These specs are a rather integration-y approach to testing ability.rb, since they rely
# on the dor-rights-auth parsing that actually gets used in the real world.  Essentially
# a giant truth table for the various combinations of object rights, object types, and user
# types that permission checking might deal with.  This is not a comprehensive listing of
# all possible permutations, but it should cover all the basics, and a number of representitive
# corner cases.  This is in lieu of the more unit test style of an ability_spec.rb.
